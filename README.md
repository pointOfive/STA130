# STA130 (Fall 2022): An Introduction to Statistical Reasoning and Data Science

Prior to Winter 2020 this was an **In-Person** course (e.g., [F18](https://ntaback.github.io/UofT_STA130/Fall2018/fall2018_course_content.html), 
[F19](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/sites/www.statistics.utoronto.ca/files/STA130_syllabus_F19.pdf), 
[W20](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/sites/www.statistics.utoronto.ca/files/STA130H1S.pdf)).
From Fall 2020 to Winter 2022 it was transitioned to an **Online** course (e.g., [W22](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019)).
The current course transitions these iterative course developments back into the previous **In-Person** format. Specifically,
the Winter 2022 Online [.ppt and pre-recording material](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019) is integrated into leveraged and reworked
[Rstudio Rmd](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fl%2Fscl%2FAACmrT8hzMyabinD1Ioc4_CWCLbgwhZx4lU&data=05%7C01%7Cscott.schwartz%40utoronto.ca%7C07bd03b4049f4302640108da3e67cd9b%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C637890913830493523%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7uY5HYCnQ9Rqp4U5KOSh9UigGyzhCfymDSehiQSC6xA%3D&reserved=0) and [beamer pdf](https://ntaback.github.io/UofT_STA130/Fall2018/fall2018_course_content.html) materials of the previous **In-Person** courses. 
At the highest level, the course objectives are to develop and practice the two steps the statistical and data science workflow:

1. Extract meaning from data through coding and analysis
2. Communicate learned knowledge in writing and speaking



## Schedule

The course (on average across students) should take 10 hours a week with 8 hours allocated for

#### Best 7/9 policy

For students having a "normal" experience acclimating to the UofT context, 
this should provide a comfortable buffer against minor unexpected events or schedule management growing pains.
For example, if you're not feeling well and think it's best to stay home on a given day,
this policy allows you to confidently make that choice (and help build increasing confidence in our in-person environment)! 
Contingencies involving **three absences** due to health related issues can be initiated through your [College Registrar](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/college-registrars-offices) and can be accomodated upon the recommendation of the Registrar with the following limitations:

- Accomodations involving **three absences** due to health related issues will be considered provided that notice of the advent of special circumstances is made to both (a) the [College Registrar](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/college-registrars-offices) and (b) sta130@utorono.ca within one week of return to University activities. 
- Accomodations beyond the "Best 7/9 policy" involving one or two health related absences will not be considered.
- Accomodations beyond the "Best 7/9 policy" involving time management challenges will not be considered.

## Course project

The course project will be done in consultation with our "project collaborator" [Dr. Heman Shakeri](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/heman-shakeri) of the [University of Virginia's](https://www.virginia.edu/) (UVA) [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) (DSI). The DSI is a recently created [School](https://datascience.virginia.edu/pages/uva-plans-new-school-data-science) (the 12th) of this [premier](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/uva-6968/overall-rankings) US university originally founded by [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva) the [principal author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) of the US [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence).

Dr. Shakeri's research, in conjuction with the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering) and 
[Systems Biology and Biomedical Data Sciences](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering/research/systems-biology-and-biomedical-data-sciences),
is motivated by the experience with cancer of a close family friend. So, Heman (Dr. Shakeri) wants to use "data-driven identification and control of high-dimensional dynamical systems" to detect deviations away from normal cellular function and intervene to interrupt the pregression of cancer before it can establish a deleterious cellular homeostasis in order to  give family's more time with their loved ones and close friends.

The data we will work with is based on advances in the fields of [Flow Cytometry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5939936/) for single cell analysis and [Mass Spectrometry](https://www.broadinstitute.org/technology-areas/what-mass-spectrometry) for measurement of cellular proteomic processes (the [phenotypical process endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) of cellular function and behavior). Based on these technologies, the multivariate landscape of proteomic activity can be measured for a single cell in any experiemental condition for any cell type (e.g., cancerous and benign cellular lines) at scale. By understanding typical cellular homeostatis of healthy and deliterious cells, and observing the phenotypical transformation of cellular proteomic homeostatsis over time in response to different treatments, it is hoped that we will eventually understand how to direct deleterious cellular states to transition into non-deleterious states. I.e., "data-driven identification and control of high-dimensional dynamical systems".

The data observations simultaneously measure 17 so-called [AP-1 transcription factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP-1_transcription_factor) over thousands of cells in a given experiemental condition. By repeatedly observing this protein complex (as is done in this data), the correlation between the different proteins can be observed. Further, the evolution of these dependencies can be observed over time as a response to different interventions. And even further, the emergence of downstream cellular phenotypes in response to changes of the state of the AP-1 system can also be observed and can be characterized through 4 other "phenotype" proteins (whose measurements are also available in this data set). Thus, though our course project, we seek to understand the inter-dependence between the AP-1 proteins, and their driving relationship with downstream cellular phenotypes, which might eventually suggest how we can intervene along this pathway to induce transformation away from deletarious cellular states. 

## Outline

### Week 1: Jupyterhub and Rstudio and R Basics

Week 1 is concerned with introducing students to R and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using [UofT's Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca). Our primary reference resources in this task are

- the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html) textbook by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund
- the [DoSS Toolkit](https://dosstoolkit.com/) created by seasoned STA130 Profs. Alexander and Caetano et al.
  - specifically the [Rstudio](https://dosstoolkit.com/#hello-world), [errors](https://dosstoolkit.com/#operating-in-an-error-prone-world),
and [packages](https://dosstoolkit.com/#holding-the-chaos-at-bay) [tutorials](https://dosstoolkit.com/#if-you-have-never-used-r-before)
- and R+Rstudio[primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2) and [Rmarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf) and [Rstudio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf) cheatsheets

> The [UofT Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) is a phenomenal resource; however, it is subject to service outages from time to time (which have in the past coincided with assignment due dates), and it can take a long time to load when there's a lot of simultaneous user demand (if a lot of students in our or another class log in at once). When you cannot use [UofT Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) you must use your own [local Rstudio instance](https://www.rstudio.com/).

> An extremely valuable skill in the context of coding for statistics and Data Science is troubleshooting and figuring things out.  Resources like the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) textbook and the the [DoSS Toolkit](https://dosstoolkit.com/) are excellent recources to learn things in a systematic, structured, and organized manner; however, google, stack exchange/overflow, and coding blog posts can be an invaluable resource for finding quick solutions for coding bugs and suggestions for how to complete a desired analyses. Hopefully through this class you will take the opportunity to build your self-sufficiency and coding-resiliance.
